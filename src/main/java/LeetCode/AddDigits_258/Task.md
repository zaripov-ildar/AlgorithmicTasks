### 258. Add Digits

<span style="background-color:#179848; color:white">Easy</span>

Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

Example 1:

    Input: num = 38
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The process is
    38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
    11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2
    Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

Example 2:

    Input: num = 0
    Output: 0



Constraints:

> - 0 <= num <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
